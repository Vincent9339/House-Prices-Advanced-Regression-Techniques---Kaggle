# House Prices Advanced Regression Techniques [Kaggle]

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices from a Kaggle competition, based on various features of the houses. The dataset contains information about various attributes of houses sold, which will be analyzed and used to create a predictive model for house prices.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). It includes the following key columns:

- **SalePrice**: The property's sale price in dollars (target variable).
- **MSZoning**: General zoning classification.
- **LotFrontage**: Linear feet of street connected to the property.
- **LotArea**: Lot size in square feet.
- **OverallQual**: Overall material and finish quality.
- **GrLivArea**: Above grade (ground) living area square feet.
- **...** *(additional relevant columns)*

## Objective
The primary objective is to create a model that accurately predicts the sale price of houses based on the various features available in the dataset. This project involves exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Exploration**: Analyzing the dataset for patterns, trends, and relationships.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and data transformations.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
4. **Model Training**: Using various regression models to predict house prices.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).

## Usage

You can explore this notebook to understand the methods and analyses conducted. The results of various models and their evaluations will help you understand the factors influencing house prices.

## Results

The project includes visualizations and model performance metrics. Key findings from the analysis include:

- **Feature Importance**: Identifying which features are most predictive of sale price.
- **Model Performance**: Comparison of different models based on their evaluation metrics.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to apply data science techniques to predict house prices effectively. The insights gained can be beneficial for real estate professionals and potential homebuyers.
